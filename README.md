# Robotics-Automation-QSTP-2020

This is a Repository for all work of 6 weeks related to Robotics Automation using ROS, during Quark Summer Technical Projects 2020 (May 2020- June 2020).
The Weeks mentioned here are step by step directories of how to go about the learning process. Each week covers a litte more in detail related to Robotics Automation.
The Project uses Python, Git, Linux (Ubuntu), ROS, and Gazebo as the main environments for code developing, testing (simulation) and sharing. The assignments in each week aim to bring about more comfort into these environments to improve the understanding of ROS and Robot Automation.
The further weeks expose various algorithms which are used in traversal of robots in an environment. We test various obstacles and see that every algorithm meets our requirements.
The final Week is a project Week in which we implemented a particular traversal algorithm to traverse through an arena which was given to us. The entire purpose of this project is that by the end of the 6 weeks, the person is ready with knowledge of basics in ROS, python, gazebo, line traversal algorithms, and Robotics Automation as a whole, and can develop an algorithm with the basic working model to simulate, control and automate a bot!
